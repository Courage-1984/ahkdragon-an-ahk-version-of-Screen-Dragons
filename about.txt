Screen Dragons is a frame-less, resizeable, movable image that can be viewed transparently and alpha-blended as a replacement for Print Screen.

Let's address the elephant in the room. It's a dragon on your screen. It's not a screensaver; it's not wallpaper. But, it's different and what we spend hours looking for just because.

So, what is it? Essentially, it's a dragon that you can use in place of Print Screen. It can be used as an image palette for holding multiple images or copying those images into another application. Used with screen capture, a Screen Dragon can be added as a logo or watermark or highlight or used to create a collage of images. Copied RTF text also adds a metafile to the clipboard, and that can be pasted into a Screen Dragon, making adding text to an image easy using capture.

Screen Dragon can be used to add almost anything to a capture; pictures, arrows, logos, bubbles, highlighted areas, comments, and more. Anything on the screen can be captured, cropped, resized, and paste into a Screen Dragon. The context menu is supported.

Use Print Screen a lot? We do. Screen Dragons adds a fun twist into the boring, Print Screen, paste monotony.
