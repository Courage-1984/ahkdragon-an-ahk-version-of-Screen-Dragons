# Steps to Compile `.exe`

1. Open "**Ahk2Exe**" *(note: not "`AutoHotkey Dash`")*
2. Drag "**ahkdragon.ahk**" onto **Source** field
3. Drag "**ahkdragon_icon.ico**" onto **Custom Icon** field *(if you want one, must be `.ico` file)*
4. Select **Base File** *(I usually go with "`v1.1.37.01 U64 AutoHotkeyU64.exe`")*
5. Click **Convert**

Compiled `.exe` file should now be in the folder where your `ahkdragon.ahk` is located if run successfully.

### Enjoy!
